## Driver Drowsiness Detection System
This project aims to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes facial features and eye movement patterns to identify signs of fatigue and alerts the driver to prevent accidents.

### Key Features:
✅ Real-time face and eye tracking using OpenCV
✅ Drowsiness detection based on eye aspect ratio (EAR)
✅ Alert system (sound or vibration) to warn the driver
✅ Deep learning-based approach using CNN (optional)
✅ Easy integration with vehicles for real-world deployment

### Tech Stack:
• Python
• OpenCV
• dlib (for facial landmark detection)
• NumPy & Pandas
• TensorFlow/Keras (optional for deep learning)
• Feel free to modify it based on the specific approach you're taking!
